Bring post formats to block themes with auto-detection, format-specific patterns, and Chat Log block for displaying conversation transcripts.

== Description ==

**Post Formats for Block Themes** brings the beloved post format functionality from classic WordPress themes to modern block themes, with intelligent pattern insertion, automatic format detection, and a streamlined editing experience that makes creating formatted content effortless.

= Why Post Formats Matter for Block Themes =

WordPress post formats have been a powerful feature since WordPress 3.1, allowing content creators to style different types of posts distinctively—quotes appear with enhanced typography, galleries showcase images prominently, status updates feel like social media, and chat transcripts display conversations beautifully. However, with the shift to block themes and Full Site Editing, this functionality was left behind.

**Post Formats for Block Themes solves this problem**. This plugin brings post formats into the block editor era with format-specific block patterns, automatic content detection, and accessibility-first design. Whether you're building a personal blog, portfolio, news site, or creative magazine, post formats help your content stand out.

= Who This Plugin Is For =

- **Bloggers** who want variety in their post presentations without creating custom templates
- **Content creators** who publish different types of content (articles, quotes, galleries, status updates)
- **News sites** migrating from classic themes and want to preserve post format functionality
- **Designers and developers** building block themes who need format support built-in
- **Accessibility advocates** who require WCAG 2.2 AA compliant content tools
- **Anyone moving from classic themes** who misses the post format features they relied on

= Key Features =

**10 Format-Specific Block Patterns**

Each WordPress post format gets a professionally-designed block pattern optimized for its content type. Patterns include locked first blocks to maintain format consistency while giving you complete creative freedom for additional content:

- **Standard** – Traditional blog post with full title, featured image, and content blocks
- **Aside** – Short note or update displayed in a styled bubble container without title requirement
- **Status** – Twitter-style status update with 280-character validation and real-time counter
- **Link** – Link sharing with automatic [Bookmark Card](https://wordpress.org/plugins/bookmark-card/) integration when available, with graceful fallback to standard linked paragraphs
- **Gallery** – Photo gallery starting with a locked gallery block for image collections
- **Image** – Single image post with prominent image display and caption support
- **Quote** – Quotation or citation with enhanced pullquote styling and attribution
- **Video** – Video content using native video blocks or popular embed services. Integrates with [Able Player](https://wordpress.org/plugins/ableplayer/) for enhanced accessible playback when available.
- **Audio** – Audio file or podcast embed with native player styling. Integrates with [Podlove Podcasting Plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/podlove-podcasting-plugin-for-wordpress/) for podcasts and [Able Player](https://wordpress.org/plugins/ableplayer/) for accessible playback when available.
- **Chat** – Conversation transcript using the integrated Chat Log block

**Integrated Chat Log Block**

**No separate plugin needed!** Post Formats for Block Themes includes a full-featured Chat Log block for displaying conversation transcripts. Perfect for interviews, customer support examples, team discussions, or any dialogue format.

Supported platforms: Slack, Discord, Microsoft Teams, WhatsApp, Telegram, Signal, and generic chat transcripts. Additional text format support: SRT subtitles, VTT captions, and plain text exports from any chat application.

Chat Log features: automatic platform detection, avatar display, timestamp formatting (relative, absolute, time-only), multiple display styles (bubbles, IRC, transcript, timeline), thread collapsing, participant lists, device frames, full accessibility, and RTL support.

**Automatic Format Detection**

Save time with intelligent format detection. The plugin analyzes your post's first block and automatically assigns the appropriate format. Gallery block becomes Gallery format, video block becomes Video format, quote block becomes Quote format, and so on. Detection runs on post save and respects manual format selections.

**Format Selection Modal**

When creating a new post, a visual format selection modal appears with all 10 formats displayed as cards showing icons, names, descriptions, and use cases. Fully keyboard accessible and screen reader friendly.

**Format Switcher Sidebar Panel**

Change formats mid-edit with the Format Switcher in the post sidebar. View current format, see auto-detection suggestions, choose to replace content or keep existing blocks. Perfect for when you change your mind about post type.

**Status Format Validation**

The Status format includes Twitter-style character validation with real-time counter, 280-character soft limit, visual feedback, accessibility announcements, and mobile-friendly composition.

**Post Format Repair Tool**

Scan existing posts and fix format mismatches with the built-in repair tool (Tools → Post Format Repair). Detects content/format mismatches, bulk or individual repairs, preview suggestions, one-click fixes. Perfect for migrating from classic themes.

**Theme-Agnostic Styling**

Format styles integrate seamlessly with any block theme using CSS custom properties from your theme.json. Respects your theme's colors, typography, spacing. No styling conflicts. Works with Global Styles.

= How to Use Post Formats in Block Themes =

**Creating Your First Formatted Post:**
1. Navigate to Posts → Add New
2. Format selection modal appears automatically
3. Click your desired format (e.g., "Quote")
4. Pattern is inserted with locked first block
5. Add content within the pattern
6. Publish your formatted post

**Mid-Edit Format Switching:**
1. Open the right sidebar while editing
2. Find the "Format Switcher" panel
3. Choose a new format from dropdown
4. Decide to replace or keep content
5. Format updates instantly

**Using Auto-Detection:**
1. Start a new post without selecting a format
2. Add content (e.g., insert a gallery block)
3. Save as draft or publish
4. Plugin automatically detects Gallery format
5. Format is assigned without manual action

= How to Create a Quote Post =

Showcase quotations and citations beautifully:

1. Select Quote format from the modal
2. The pullquote pattern loads with locked Quote block
3. Type or paste your quote
4. Add attribution in citation field
5. Optional: Add commentary below the quote
6. Customize styling via Global Styles
7. Publish your enhanced quote post

The locked pullquote maintains format integrity while allowing unlimited additional content blocks.

= How to Display Chat Conversations =

Turn conversation transcripts into readable, attractive content:

1. Select Chat format when creating new post
2. Chat Log block inserts automatically
3. Copy conversation text from Slack, Discord, Teams, WhatsApp, etc.
4. Paste into Chat Log block—platform detection is automatic
5. Configure display options: style, avatars, timestamps, threads, device frame
6. Preview the formatted conversation
7. Publish your beautiful chat transcript

Platform-specific features: Slack preserves channels, threads, reactions; Discord maintains server structure and roles; Teams retains meeting context; WhatsApp shows message status and reply chains; Telegram preserves stickers; Signal maintains message indicators.

= How to Automatically Detect Post Formats =

Let the plugin handle format assignment:

1. Create new post without selecting format
2. Add content normally (gallery, video, quote, etc.)
3. Save draft or publish—detection runs on save
4. Check Format Switcher panel for detected format
5. Accept or manually override

Detection rules: first block determines format. Gallery block = Gallery format, Video block = Video format, Quote block = Quote format, and so on. Detection only runs on posts without manual format selection.

= How to Repair Mismatched Formats =

Fix format assignments across your entire site:

1. Navigate to Tools → Post Format Repair
2. Click "Scan All Posts"—analyzes content vs. formats
3. Review mismatch report
4. Preview suggestions for each post
5. Bulk repair all or fix individually
6. Verify changes

Common scenarios: migrating from classic themes, imported content, incorrect manual assignments, exploring your format distribution. The repair tool is safe—changes only format meta, never modifies post content.

= Migrating from Classic Theme Post Formats =

Preserve post format styling when switching to block themes:

**Before Migration:**
1. Install plugin on classic theme site
2. Leave classic theme active
3. Test repair tool with scan (don't apply yet)
4. Review the report

**During Migration:**
1. Switch to block theme
2. Activate Post Formats for Block Themes
3. Visit Tools → Post Format Repair
4. Run full scan
5. Review suggestions
6. Apply bulk repair

**After Migration:**
1. Check frontend display
2. Customize styling in theme.json
3. Create new posts with format patterns
4. Optional: update old posts to use patterns

What transfers: format assignments, post content, featured images, post meta. What changes: theme template styling becomes pattern styling, classic PHP templates become block templates. Tips: test on staging first, take database backup, check one post per format, customize theme.json colors, use patterns for new content.

= Block Theme Compatibility Guide =

**What Makes a "Block Theme":**
Block themes use block templates (.html files) and theme.json instead of PHP templates. Key characteristics: templates/ folder with .html files, theme.json file, Full Site Editing support, activated via Appearance → Themes. Learn more in the [WordPress Block Theme documentation](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/block-themes/).

**Why Classic Themes Aren't Supported:**
Classic themes use PHP template files which conflict with block-based patterns. This plugin requires block pattern support, block templates, theme.json styling, and block editor integration. If you prefer using a classic theme with post format support, consider using the [Twenty Thirteen theme](https://wordpress.org/themes/twentythirteen/) which includes excellent built-in post format styling.

**Recommended Compatible Block Themes:**
Twenty Twenty-Five, Twenty Twenty-Four, Twenty Twenty-Three, Block themes from Automattic (Blank Canvas, Pendant), most modern block themes on WordPress.org.

**Theme.json Integration:**
The plugin reads color palette, typography, spacing, and border styles from your theme.json. Format styles automatically adapt. To customize, edit your theme.json color and typography settings.

= Developer Guide: Extending Post Formats =

**Add Custom Format:**
```php
add_filter( 'pfbt_registered_formats', function( $formats ) {
    $formats['review'] = [
        'name'         => 'Review',
        'description'  => 'Product review',
        'icon'         => 'star-filled',
        'pattern_slug' => 'my-theme/review-pattern',
    ];
    return $formats;
} );
```

**Custom Detection Logic:**
```php
add_filter( 'pfbt_detected_format', function( $format, $first_block, $all_blocks ) {
    if ( $first_block['blockName'] === 'my-plugin/custom-block' ) {
        return 'gallery';
    }
    return $format;
}, 10, 3 );
```

**Run Code After Detection:**
```php
add_action( 'pfbt_format_detected', function( $post_id, $format, $post ) {
    error_log( "Post {$post_id} detected as {$format}" );
}, 10, 3 );
```

**Track Format Changes:**
```php
add_action( 'pfbt_format_changed', function( $post_id, $old_format, $new_format ) {
    // Analytics tracking
}, 10, 3 );
```

More filters and actions available for pattern content modification, post-repair actions, and format definition customization.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this work with classic themes? =

No, this plugin requires block themes with Full Site Editing. Classic themes use PHP templates incompatible with block patterns. This plugin requires block theme with theme.json, block templates in templates/ folder, and WordPress 6.8+. Consider migrating to a modern block theme like Twenty Twenty-Five.

= Will this work with my existing posts? =

Yes! Use **Post Format Repair Tool** (Tools → Post Format Repair) to scan existing posts and automatically detect appropriate formats based on content. Tool analyzes first block and suggests matching format. Review before applying repairs. Tool only changes format assignments—never modifies actual content.

= What happens if I deactivate the plugin? =

Content remains safe: format assignments stay in database, pattern blocks remain as standard blocks, Chat Log blocks show as "unsupported block" (content preserved), no data lost. If you reactivate, all functionality returns immediately.

= Can I customize the format patterns? =

Yes, multiple ways:
- Use filters in functions.php to modify pattern HTML
- Register custom patterns to override defaults
- Edit blocks after insertion (locked first block maintains consistency)
- Use Global Styles to change colors, typography, spacing

= Does the Status format prevent publishing over 280 characters? =

No, 280-character limit is a soft suggestion, not a hard block. Shows real-time counter, visual warning when approaching limit, accessibility announcements, but you CAN publish longer status updates if needed.

= What is the Bookmark Card integration? =

Link format checks if the [Bookmark Card plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/bookmark-card/) is installed. If active, uses bookmark-card blocks with rich previews, images, descriptions, automatic metadata fetching. If not installed, uses standard linked paragraphs. Both work perfectly—integration just enhances experience.

= Does this work with podcasting plugins? =

Yes! The Audio format integrates with the [Podlove Podcasting Plugin for WordPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/podlove-podcasting-plugin-for-wordpress/) when installed. If Podlove is active, Audio format patterns can utilize Podlove's enhanced audio player and podcast metadata. Without Podlove, the plugin uses WordPress core audio blocks which work perfectly for standard audio content.

= What about accessible media players? =

The Video and Audio formats integrate with [Able Player](https://wordpress.org/plugins/ableplayer/) when installed. Able Player provides an accessible HTML5 media player with captions, audio descriptions, interactive transcripts, and full keyboard support. When Able Player is active, format patterns can utilize its enhanced accessible playback features. Without Able Player, the plugin uses WordPress core media blocks.

= How do I use the Chat format? =

**You don't need a separate plugin!** Post Formats for Block Themes includes integrated Chat Log block (chatlog/conversation). Chat format works out of the box, no additional plugins required. Just select Chat format and paste conversation transcripts from Slack, Discord, Teams, WhatsApp, Signal, or Telegram.

= Can I change formats after creating a post? =

Absolutely! Use **Format Switcher** in post sidebar. Open post in block editor, find Format Switcher panel in right sidebar, click format dropdown, choose new format, decide to replace or keep content, click Switch Format. Format updates immediately.

= How does auto-detection know when NOT to change my format? =

Auto-detection respects manual choices. Detection WILL run on: new posts without format selection, posts never explicitly formatted, programmatically created posts. Detection WON'T run on: manually selected formats, Format Switcher changes, posts with internal user-selected flag, Quick Edit manual formats. Once you choose manually, auto-detection defers to you.

= Can I use this with WooCommerce or custom post types? =

Yes! Register post format support for custom post types:
```php
add_post_type_support( 'product', 'post-formats' );  // WooCommerce
add_post_type_support( 'portfolio', 'post-formats' );  // Custom type
```
Then formats and plugin features work for those types. Patterns and modal only appear in block editor.

= Does this work with multisite? =

Yes! Fully multisite compatible. Install network-wide or per-site, each site has independent format settings, repair tool scans only current site's posts, no database conflicts, pattern registration respects site context. For large networks, consider network activation.
