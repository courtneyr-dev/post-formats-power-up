## Template System Architecture

### Understanding the Template System

**Key Concepts:**

1. **Template Files**: Located in `/templates/single-format-[type].html`
   - Written in WordPress block markup
   - Define structure for each format
   - Can be customized via Site Editor

2. **Template Registration**: Handled by `class-format-styles.php`
   - `add_block_templates()` filter adds templates to list
   - `get_block_file_template()` filter loads template content
   - Templates appear in Appearance → Editor → Templates

3. **Automatic Assignment**: Handled by `auto_assign_template()`
   - Runs on `save_post` hook
   - Sets `_wp_page_template` meta based on format
   - Standard format clears template assignment

4. **Template Customization**:
   - Users edit templates in Site Editor
   - WordPress stores customizations in database
   - Original plugin templates remain unchanged
   - Can revert to default by deleting customization
