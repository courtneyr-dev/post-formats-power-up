# Changelog

All notable changes to Post Formats for Block Themes will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.1.3] - 2025-12-18

### Added
- Settings link on Plugins page that links to Post Format Repair tool
- Revision limiter for wp_block post type (limits to 3 revisions to prevent database bloat)
- Asset file for Post Format Block script dependencies

### Changed
- Simplified all format patterns by removing unnecessary wrapper Group blocks
- Status pattern now uses single paragraph with `status-paragraph` class
- Aside pattern now uses single paragraph (no wrapper)
- All other format patterns now use primary block + paragraph structure
- Pattern Manager now uses transient-based caching to avoid unnecessary database operations
- Pattern registration skipped entirely on front-end for better performance
- Pattern updates only occur when content has actually changed

### Fixed
- **Critical:** Performance issue with revision queries returning 11,000+ rows on sites with many synced patterns
- Duplicate pattern insertion when selecting format from modal (patterns were being inserted twice)
- Status format character counter appearing twice in editor
- Aside format icon not displaying in Posts admin list (changed from `dashicons-aside` to `dashicons-format-aside`)
- JavaScript error "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'postCategories')" in block editor
- Pattern transient cleared on plugin deactivation to ensure fresh patterns on reactivation

### Security
